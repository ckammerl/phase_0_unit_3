### Reflection
What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?
SQL is completely new to me and it helped me a lot to go through the material/vidoes you referenced. 

What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
I looked up 
aggregated functions 

sub queries/ SQL join 
http://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlite/sqlite_sub_queries.htm
http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_join.asp

HAVING clause

Overviews

http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_quickref.asp

What concepts are you having trouble with?
I haven't fully understood how the CASE statement is implemented within the SELECT command and will continue looking for a good explanation.
use keywords SELECT, FROM, WHERE - confident
LIMIT, and ORDER BY - haven't used them often in the exercises so far

Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy? having a good start after going through the various resources provided (video/reading material)

Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
I had to repeat some quizzes at sqlzoo because the symstem automatically logged me out at some point; and if I didn't catch that moment and submitted, entries were not saved..
